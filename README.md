# High Spender Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict potential high spender customers by analyzing user behavior and demographic data using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to support data-driven business strategies by identifying features that influence spending patterns.

## Objective
To build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer is a high spender based on their attributes. This helps optimize marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and revenue growth initiatives.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Demographics (gender, age, income)
- Behavioral metrics (visit frequency, signup date, activity)
- Derived variables created via feature engineering

## Project Workflow
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (including PCA)
- Feature Selection (forward & backward selection, Lasso regularization)
- Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Cross-Validation
- SHAP Analysis for model interpretability

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git for version control

## Results
- Achieved high precision in identifying top spenders
- SHAP visualizations highlight the most influential features
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest yielded strong performance with interpretable outputs

## Structure
- `Project_Business.ipynb` – Main notebook
- `presentation.pptx` – Final slides
- `report.pdf` – Detailed written report
- `images/` – Visualizations used in the project

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world business problems, offering interpretable, validated, and impactful insights for strategic decisions.
